## Hey! I'm Georgy ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **developer and founder**, currently building [**AB-TASK**](https://ab-task.com). This app helps teams remove the friction of scattered tools and lost context.  

Alongside AB-TASK, I recently launched [**Velna.ai**](https://velna.ai) â€” an AI automation agency that helps startups and small teams replace manual outreach with custom-built AI agents. We focus on real results: more leads, less repetitive work, and faster workflows.

Before this, I ran **ERP-LAB**, leading a team to build custom ERP solutions used by thousands daily. Iâ€™ve also worked as a **senior engineer** at companies like **Shogun and Calipsa**, focusing on **JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS, and AI adoption**.  

Now, Iâ€™m fully focused on **growing AB-TASK**, keeping collaboration smooth and efficient, and learning the **startup game**. 

Feel free to reach out on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnemtsov/). I'm always happy to connect! ðŸ¤—
